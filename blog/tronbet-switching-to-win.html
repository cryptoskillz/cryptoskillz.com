They also have this odd methodology of releasing a press release, which is usually very ambiguous and requires clarification and instead of doing this they treat the press release as a work of Shakespearean art and refuse to give any more details (often these press releases are good news) resulting in them taking hell in their telegram channel for days or even weeks.</em></p><p> </p><p id="aa34" data-selectable-paragraph="">This quick article is an update to the “<a class="bx di lt lu lv lw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://medium.com/@cryptoskillz_58791/how-i-got-my-trx-for-free-using-tronbet-62f4b30f1ef7"><strong class="mm nd">how I got my tronbet for free</strong></a>” article I wrote some time ago. “<a href="https://www.tronbet.io/" class="bx di lt lu lv lw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong class="mm nd">Tronbet</strong></a>” is a gambling site with it’s own token that sits int he Tron network.</p><p id="d7b2" class="mk ml ct ba mm b mn my mp mz mr na mt nb mv nc mx" data-selectable-paragraph="">They made a very important “<a class="bx di lt lu lv lw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://medium.com/@tronbethelp/ante-win-prepare-for-take-off-353d41b43401"><strong class="mm nd">announcement</strong></a><strong class="mm nd">”</strong> yesterday which have rattled their community and rightly so.</p><p id="2ed1" class="mk ml ct ba mm b mn my mp mz mr na mt nb mv nc mx" data-selectable-paragraph="">It is worth noting the last major change they made was moving to a platform so others could build upon their original dice game which lead to the live casino, slots, poker and soon sports betting. When they did this the plan was so ambitious that I did not think they could pull it off so I sold my ANTE (their token) for a decent profit and sat on the sidelines for a few months. Needless to say, hit every “<a href="https://cdn.tronbet.io/pdf/whitepaper_en.pdf" class="bx di lt lu lv lw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong class="mm nd">milestone</strong></a>” the price of ANTE rose and I bought back in. Sometime around then (I forgot the exact date) they built their own “<a href="https://trontrade.io/" class="bx di lt lu lv lw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong class="mm nd">exchange</strong></a>” as they were unhappy about the quality of the exchanges out there and this is now the default place to trade ANTE (this becomes important later) and (I believe) this is the largest ANTE trading exchange.</p><h2 id="321b" class="ni ly ct ba az dw nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong class="cd">So Skilz, the announcement what is it, why is the community going a little mental right now?</strong></h2><p id="2d01" class="mk ml ct ba mm b mn mo mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx" data-selectable-paragraph="">Good question (me) basically it boils down the fact they are swapping their main token ANTE for one called WIN and then doing an AIRDROP for their LIVE (the casino token) with bonus WIN.</p><p id="a862" class="mk ml ct ba mm b mn my mp mz mr na mt nb mv nc mx" data-selectable-paragraph="">In the crypto space, we are used to exit scams and I am in no way saying this is what Tronebt is doing. They have never seemed like this is their end goal but the fact remains we have been burned enough and there are enough deltas (things they have done) that as an ANTE holder you should rightly be nervous.</p><h2 id="36fb" class="ni ly ct ba az dw nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt" data-selectable-paragraph="">Wow, this sounds great Skillz, is this just a case of the internet being scared of changing and yelling at it like they always do?</h2><p id="ffae" class="mk ml ct ba mm b mn mo mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx" data-selectable-paragraph="">Yes and no.

This was my decision and when they hit their milestones I bought back in around (15 TRX) and I had sold at 12 TRX and I was happy to do this as with all the milestones they crushed it was worth more (so I paid more). Now other people like the iron-willed Tommy Moustache (if you are ever in a war you want this man on your side, trust me) did not sell and made a greater return than me over that period again (and this is crucially important) this was his decision to make.</p><p id="87b2" class="mk ml ct ba mm b mn my mp mz mr na mt nb mv nc mx" data-selectable-paragraph="">The reason I am in crypto (and also a lot of other people) is that we want to be in control of our money if we make a dumb decision it is on us.
